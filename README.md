# **Spotify Music Engagement Project**

Music engagement isn't just about plays â€” it's about energy, mood, and true fan interaction. In this project, I explored Gorillaz' Spotify dataset, analyzing energy, emotions, and cross-platform performance to uncover deep insights that raw views alone can't show.

Skills and Tools:

PostgreSQL (Window Functions, CTEs, Correlation Analysis)

Data Cleaning and Transformation

Business Insight Generation
